# World of Walker data leak

*Merely minutes after launch, I discovered a critical flaw in the world of walker site, that could leak any user's full name, email address, country, and date of birth - simply from their walker ID.*

A bit of context: The [World of Walker site](https://worldofwalker.com/) is a <abbr title='Progressive Web Application'>PWA</abbr> developed by Kreatell for <abbr title="If you don't know who this is, I'm sorry for you.">Alan Walker</abbr>. Also, literally on the front page of the site:

> The World of Walker isn’t just a platform - it’s your ultimate hub as a Walker.

Yeah... what would you expect from a vibecoded site. 🙄

## Finding a Walker ID

If you didn't know, finding an Alan Walker fan's Walker ID is trivially easy.

Examples:

- The Discord server, where thousands of users have their Walker ID in their display name or bio.
- The Minecraft server, where many players have placed signs with their Walker ID and username for a petition.

Or... just ask someone. And they'll probably give it to you. It's like a social media handle.

## The Bug

On 08/08/25, a few minutes after the World of Walker app launch, I was trying to create an account, as well as the other thousands of users who had been waiting months for this day. However, we were getting stuck on verifying.
I decided to look in console, and found this message:

```json
{
  "code":"TooManyConcurrentRequests",
  "message":"Too many concurrent requests. Your backend is limited to 16 concurrent mutations. To get more resources, upgrade to Convex Pro. If you are already on Convex Pro, please contact support."
}
```

So from here I could tell the app was using a Convex backend. Actually, before this I didn't even know what Convex was, so I just googled this error message and found out about Convex.

Next I looked at the network requests tab.

I saw a network request to the Convex database: `https://backend-vk8gk4ookgkwcgk8g0kk4kso.kreatell.gg`. I would redact that, but it's not particularly hard to find from the website anyway. Also don't bother visiting that URL in your browser, it literally just redirects to the WoW site.

Let's not get carried away. The route was `/api/mutation`, and there was a JSON payload:

```json
{
  "path": "users:ensureUserExists",
  "format": "convex_encoded_json",
  "args": [
    {
      "clerkUserId": "user_xxx",
      "email": "xxx@xxx.com",
      "ensureWalkerId": true,
      "nickname": "xxx",
      "walkerId": 1234
    }
  ]
}
```

This gave us several clues.

1. `path`: `users:ensureUserExists`
   - This, obviously, tells us that there is a backend path for ensuring a user exists.
2. `format`: `convex_encoded_json`
   - This tells us that the API is being sent to Convex, as expected.
3. `args`: `[...]`
   - This provides arguments to the `ensureUserExists` backend route. The arguments shown were the ones entered from the login page.
4. The Response
   - The response was the Convex TooManyConcurrentRequests error shown previously. This would have been the root cause of the login failure for me and all the other users: the fact that the Convex tier only allowed 16 concurrent logins at once.

From here, I decided to continue watching the login page for more browser requests.
I eventually saw this:

Route: `/api/query`
Payload:
```json
{
  "path": "users:getUserByClerkId",
  "format": "convex_encoded_json",
  "args": [
    {
      "clerkUserId": "user_abcd1234"
    }
  ]
}
```

This gave us more clues.
1. `/api/query`
   - Since this is a query, and not a mutation, this route was succeeding and giving us information, instead of an error message.
2. `path`: `users:getUserByClerkId`
   - This path on the backend allows us to get user information simply from their Clerk ID.
3. `args`: `[...]`
   - The args are simply just the `clerkUserId` to find the user from.
4. The Response
   - The response was a 200 message with the JSON data, instead of a 429, as the route did not have the limit set for mutations.
     Here is the response:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "value": {
    "_creationTime": 1754634301971.9727,
    "_id": "xxxxx",
    "ageVerified": true,
    "clerkUserId": "user_abcd1234",
    "country": "XX",
    "createdAt": 1754634301972,
    "dateOfBirth": "XXXX-XX-XX",
    "email": "xxx@xxx.com",
    "experiencePoints": 0,
    "lastUpdated": 1754634511192,
    "level": 1,
    "lumin": 0,
    "nickname": "John Doe",
    "schemaVersion": 4,
    "totalEarned": 0,
    "totalSpent": 0,
    "walkerId": 123456,
    "walkoins": 0
  }
}
```

This gives us a whole lot of information.
Most importantly, it tells us:
- Their country: `["value"]["country"]`
- Their email: `["value"]["email"]`
- Their D.O.B: `["value"]["dateOfBirth"]`
- Their full name: `["value"]["nickname"]`

I could get all this from just a user's `clerkUserId`.
But, how would we get a users clerkUserId from just their Walker ID?

To put it simply, trial and error.

First, I tried changing the argument from `clerkUserID` to `walkerId`, and inputting a Walker ID.

I got the error:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "errorMessage": "[Request ID: b1c1fd6a9bb990a5] Server Error\nArgumentValidationError: Object is missing the required field `clerkUserId`. Consider wrapping the field validator in `v.optional(...)` if this is expected.\n\nObject: {walkerId: 123456.0}\nValidator: v.object({clerkUserId: v.string()})\n\n"
}
```

> [Request ID: b1c1fd6a9bb990a5] Server Error
> ArgumentValidationError: Object is missing the required field `clerkUserId`. Consider wrapping the field validator in `v.optional(...)` if this is expected.
>
> Object: {walkerId: 123456.0}
> Validator: v.object({clerkUserId: v.string()})

So, the `getUserByClerkId` path required a `clerkUserId` argument. Understandable.

Next, I tried to change the path from `users:getUserByClerkId` to `users:getUserByWalkerId`, keeping the `walkerId` argument.

Uh... it worked!

It provided all the same data as the previous `getUserByClerkId` response. This means, it gives us their country, email, date of birth, and full name!

## Disclosure

At 07:42 BST on the day I found the bug (08/08/25), I sent a DM on Discord to a Local Community Manager, informing them about the bug, including an example.
Merely 5 minutes later, at 07:47 BST, they told me that they had shared the matter with Team Alan India, and they were sending the matter to the main headquarters.

At 07:54 I finished a brief overview of the bug and sent it to them via email. By 07:58AM, the Head of Interactive Experiences (Olaf) had seen the bug and sent it to the developers.

At 09:29, the team requested to speak to me. At 09:47, Bitsnoxx (who seemed to be the lead developer) asked me more about the exploit.

Although I'm not sure when exactly it was fixed, somewhere between 11:46 and 14:37 the bug had been fixed, and the server was now responding with

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "errorMessage": "[Request ID: 5206b5e8719df7c8] Server Error\nUncaught Error: Authentication required\n    at requireAuth (../../convex/auth.ts:10:9)\n    at async handler (../convex/users.ts:121:9)\n"
}
```

> [Request ID: 5206b5e8719df7c8] Server Error
> Uncaught Error: Authentication required
>     at requireAuth (../../convex/auth.ts:10:9)
>     at async handler (../convex/users.ts:121:9)

But they still definitely should have put a 401 or 403 there. That is still an incredibly leaky error message.

## Conclusion

This bug was a huge privacy issue, but luckily got fixed fast enough due to responsible reporting. I was told it was an 'IDOR', an Insecure Direct Object Reference attack.

Oh, and I didn't get any bounty for it.
